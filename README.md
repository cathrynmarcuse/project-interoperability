# Project Interoperability

IMPORTANT: THIS IS A DRAFT. LARGE PARTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND MAY REFER BACK TO PROJECT OPEN DATA THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF MARCH.

## Problem this Solves

Our government needs to share information better, faster, and smarter. Our mission is to improve the government's ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time.

## How this Project Solves this Problem

We're providing these guidelines and tools to collaborate with our partners to develop information interoperability in government. We hope you'll help us improve this. This project is based on [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io). Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
