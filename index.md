##1. Background

IMPORTANT: THIS IS A DRAFT. LARGE PARTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND MAY REFER BACK TO PROJECT OPEN DATA THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF MARCH.

We hope you help us improve and adopt this as a resource to build information interoperability throught the Information Sharing Environment. Learn more about us at [ISE.gov](http://ise.gov).

2-2 [Vision and Sustainability](open-standards/) - Standards, specifications, and formats supporting open data objectives.   

2-3 [ISE Information Integrated Landscape](glossary/) - The glossary of open data terms.

2-4 [ISE Information Interoperability Framework](open-licenses/) - The definition for open licenses. 

2-5 [Exchange Patterns](schema/) - The schema used to describe datasets, APIs, and published data at agency.gov/data. 

2-6 [Architecture Framework Alignment](glossary/) - More I2F tools.

2-7 [Building Interoperability into Mission-based Architectures](glossary/) - Review Reference Architecture and Assess

2-8 [Building Interoperability into Mission-based Architectures](glossary/) - Vet Reference Architecture and Build in Information Interoperability

##4. More

We have broken the Information Interoperability Framework, or I2F, into components so that we can collaborate with you, our stakeholders and partners, to edit and improve it. You can [download the I2F PDF](http://ise.gov), as it was approved by the ISA IPC on (date). The content in this project may differ from the PDF because it is a work in progress only based on the I2F PDF.

3-1 [Chapter 1](/policy-memo/) - Full text of the memorandum.  

3-2 [Chapter 2](/implementation-guide/) - Official OMB implementation guidance for each step of implementing the policy. 

3-3 [Chapter 3](/catalog/) - The specific guidance for publishing the Open Data Catalog at the agency.gov/data page.  

3-4 [Chapter 4](/faq/) - A growing list of common questions and answers to facilitate adoption of open data projects.  

3-5 [Chapter 5](http://goals.performance.gov/opendata) - Information on the development of the Open Data CAP goal as required in the [Open Data Executive Order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government).

##4. Case Studies

Case studies of novel or best practices from agencies who are leading in open data help others understand the challenges and opportunities for success.

6-1 [Department of Labor API Program](labor-case-study/) - A department perspective on developing APIs for general use and, in particular, building the case for an ecosystem of users by developing SDKs.

6-2 [Department of Transportation Enterprise Data Inventory](transportation-case-study/) - A review of DOT's strategy and policy when creating a robust data inventory program.  

6-3 [Disaster Assistance Program Coordination](fema-case-study/) - The coordinated campaign led by FEMA has integrated a successful data exchange among 16 agencies to coordinate an important public service.  

6-4 [Environmental Protection Agency Central Data Exchange](epa-case-study/) - The agency's data exchange provides a model for programs that seek to coordinate the flow of data among industry, state, local, and tribal entities.  

6-5 [FederalRegister.gov API](https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2012/11/FR2-API-Case-Study1.pdf) - A core government program update that has grown into an important public service.

6-6 [National Broadband Map](http://www.scribd.com/doc/109998799/The-National-Broadband-Map-A-Case-Study-on-Open-Innovation-for-National-Policy) - The National Broadband Map, a case study on open innovation for national policy.  Produced by the [Wilson Center](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/).

6-7 [National Renewable Energy Laboratory API program](http://developer.nrel.gov/api-case-study/) - An agency perspective on developing APIs for general use and in particular building the case for the internal re-use of the resources.

6-8 [USAID Crowdsourcing to Open Data](http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/economic_growth_and_trade/development_credit/pdfs/2012/USAIDCrowdsourcingCaseStudy.pdf) - A case study that shows how USAID invited the "crowd" to clean and geocode a USAID dataset in order to open and map the data.
